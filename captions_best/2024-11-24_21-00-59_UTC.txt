The video captures a city street scene on a rainy day. The street is wet, reflecting the lights from the surrounding buildings and vehicles, creating a shimmering effect. Tall buildings with various architectural styles line both sides of the street, some with illuminated windows. A few pedestrians are seen walking along the sidewalk, one of whom is holding an umbrella. The sky is overcast, contributing to the overall gloomy atmosphere. The scene remains consistent throughout the video, with minimal changes in the positions of the pedestrians and vehicles.
